### What I learned

I learned How To Do Carousel but it is hard to design/code this layout without any JS framework. It is hard to control HTML and CSS with Vanilla Js.I should Learn React Js or Vue just for making things much easier.Actually i built this project 1.5 weeks ago but i completely forgot about it so i'm just pushing this to GITHUB.
